# Examples
This directory (will) contain or link to examples of how NGSI-LD and WoT can be used together.

## To Do
* Look at NGSI-LD Primers and try to apply WoT concepts to examples there.
* Look up past WoT presentations e.g. on functional safety, spatial data, and digital twins
  
## Possible Topics

### Functional clustering of resources
Unified, more abstract interface that can reorganize resources by function.
Comment: WoT TDs can combine resources from different physical devices or services.

### Digital twin modelling
* Resource for landscape of standards: @@@@ Rigo
* Need to be specific... clearly define sub-cases
* Related to Smart Cities IG/use cases
* Related to geofencing/spatial data
* Boundaries

### Onboarding of devices described by TDs into NSGI-LD systems

### Describing NGSI-LD services with WoT TDs

### Privacy/Security/Safety and Access Controls
* Metadata risks
* Authorized actions and roles
* Interactions with smart data management systems
* Devices with built-in security/privacy/safety policies
* For example, devices with functional safety interlocks
